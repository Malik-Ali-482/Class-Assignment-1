1.In a right triangle, the square of the length of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths
of the other two sides. Write a program that prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a
triangle and then outputs a message indicating whether the triangle is a right triangle.

2. A box of cookies can hold 24 cookies, and a container can hold 75 boxes of cookies. Write a program
that prompts the user to enter the total number of cookies, the number of cookies in a box, and the
number of cookie boxes in a container. The program then outputs the number of boxes and the number
of containers to ship the cookies. Note that each box must contain the specified number of cookies, and
each container must contain the specified number of boxes. If the last box of cookies contains less than
the number of specified cookies, you can discard it and output the number of leftover cookies. Similarly,
if the last container contains less than the number of specified boxes, you can discard it and output the
number of leftover boxes. Store the result in a file.

3. Write a C++ program that takes input from the file in the form of seconds and converts it into
a comprehensive time representation. The program should take input from the file having the
number of seconds, perform calculations to convert these seconds into years, months, days,
hours, minutes, and seconds, and display the results. Furthermore, it should offer the user the
option to convert the seconds into weeks, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The challenge
lies in handling various time units accurately, considering leap years, and dealing with months
of different lengths, all while providing clear and user-friendly output. This program should
ensure both accuracy and user-friendliness in its time conversions.
Note: File contains more than one number. Your program should convert each number
accordingly

4. The roots of a quadratic equation ax2 + bx + c = 0, a ≠ 0 are given by the following formula:

−b ± √b
2 − 4ac
2a

In this formula, the term b2 − 4ac is called the discriminant. If b

2 − 4ac = 0, then the equation has a single

(repeated) root. If b

2 − 4ac > 0, the equation has two real roots. If b

2 − 4ac < 0, the equation has two
complex roots. Write a program that prompts the user to input the value of a (the coefficient of x
2
), b (the
coefficient of x), and c (the constant term) and outputs the type of roots of the equation. Furthermore, if
b
2 − 4ac ≥ 0, the program should output the roots of the quadratic equation. Handle the exceptions
properly.
